REDIS DATA STORE**********************
Redis is not databse.
Caching data.
We can store JSON type data. Like key value pair.
Some data we require frequently so redis save everything in RAM.Also make sure redis doesnt 
make your system low on ram.

In TERMINAL
>REDIS-CLI
Store key-value pair.
value will always be string.
>{key: "[1,2,4]"}

Example data:
{age:"28", name: "rachit"}
>SET name rachit // this is key
>GET name
>SET age 28
>DEL age
>exists name //check key exists
>exists age ==> 0 //No key

>KEYS * //all keys
>SET age 28
>KEYS *  //show all
>FLUSHALL //deletes everything
>KEYS * //NOW became Empty
>ttl name //check the last updated name
>expire name 5 //expires memory after 5sec (returns -2 after expire)
>setex name rachit //expiring at setting the data

Stack and Queue as array {"john",##,###}
lpush , rpush 
lpop , rpop
>lpush friends john //add at zero index in friends
>GET friends //does not work on array only strings
>LRANGE friends 0 -1 //for looping array and print from zero-last index

>rpush friends Romy
>LRANGE friends 0 -1
>lpush friends arun
>LRANGE friends 0 -1 

>lpop friends 
>rpop friends

hobbies : ["weight lifing ","weight","w"]
>SADD hobbies "weight lifting" //create set of hobbies
>SADD hobbies "weight"
>SADD hobbies "w"
>SMEMBERS hobbies  //show all elemetns in hobbies 

Adding Objects [we call the hashes]
person: {age: "10"}
>HSET person name rachit
>HGET person name //value
>HGETALL person   //key and value
>HDEL person age
>HEXISTS person age



postGres is a database*******************************
In TERMINAL
sEMI COLON IS NECESSARY.
>psql -U postgres;
>CREATE USER ARUN with PASSWORD 'PASS';
>CREATE DATABASE devs;
>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE devs to ARUN;
>DROP DATABASE devs
database is a collection of tables.

>\L CHECK ALL DATABASE
>\C CONNECT TO DATABASE
>\D TYPE OF COLUMNS OF DATA
