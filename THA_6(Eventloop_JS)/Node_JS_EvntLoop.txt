Javscript and need for evnt loop:
>Browsers were not given all the system resources for processing in javascript. 
>Event Loop is nothing but an algorithm that handles async nature of javascript.
>Async nature in javascipt is when we dont wait for processing hungry task to be completed earlier in time . They are delayed untill all the small less hungry tasks are allowed to run first.   
>Javascript is single threaded , non-blocking , Asynchronous, concurrent language executed in browser.
> I have call stack, event loop , call back Queue and some other api and stuff.
>Googles v8 engine is used to compile javascript very fast. It has only call-stack and heap only.


HEAP ==> memory allocation
Stack ==> Execution Context

Javascript_Execution of Event loops:
Web API calls ==> Queues all task calls in (FIFO) manner ==>Evnt loop==>call stack
**************** Explanation :*******************
 async Web api call happend in code ,all this calls gets into Callback_Queue ,Now if Call_Stack is empty Event_Loop takes one item from Callback_Queue and pushes it into Call_Stack to get executed
